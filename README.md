# Titanic Survival Analysis

This R code was created to build a predictive survival model from the [Intro to Data Science with R](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLTJTBoU5HOCRrTs3cJK-PbHM39cwCU0PF) series by David Langer. The data set from the historical Titanic event was supplied by [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/c/titanic/data) as a competition.
